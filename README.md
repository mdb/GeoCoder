GeoCoder

About
-----

GeoCoder is a simple HTML- and JavaScript-based front end demonstrating how
to utilize the Google Maps API to geocode street addresses.

GeoCoder was inspired by Casey Thomas's [geocoder][]. Much like Casey's 
geocoder, GeoCoder allows users to geocode addresses, get the standardized
addresses and coordinates for their input, and see the results on a map.
